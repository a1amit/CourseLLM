## Data Flow Examples

### Example 1: Student Asks Question
1. Student starts **ChatSession** for a **Course**.
2. Student sends **ChatMessage** (role: `user`).
3. System retrieves relevant **CourseMaterials** (RAG).
4. System generates **ChatMessage** (role: `assistant`), citing **CourseMaterials**.
5. System updates **LearningProgress** based on topics discussed.

### Example 2: Instructor Grades Assignment
1. Instructor views **Submissions** for an **Assignment**.
2. AI generates draft **grade** and **feedback** for each **Submission**.
3. Instructor reviews, adjusts, and publishes grades.
4. System updates **LearningProgress** for each **Student** based on grade and assignment **topics**.

### Example 3: Student Completes Learning Trajectory
1. Student masters a **CourseTopic** (reaches **mastery_criteria**).
2. **LearningProgress** status changes to `mastered`.
3. System unlocks dependent **CourseTopics** (where this topic was a prerequisite).
4. Dashboard recommends next **CourseTopic** to study.
