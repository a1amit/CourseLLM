## 1. Overview & Vision

**Product Name:** CourseLLM

**Vision:**  
Help teachers and students in a Computer Science Department better teach and learn using AI that enhances existing course material.

**Core Principle:**  
CourseLLM enhances the learning experience around existing course material through intelligent, context-aware AI assistance, without creating new material or replacing existing tools.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### For Students:
- Students want enhanced, personalized access to course material to learn better, deeper, and faster.
- Current tools lack integration with specific course context and learning trajectories.
- Students need help understanding "why" material matters, not just "how" it works.

### For Teachers:
- Teachers worry students use AI as shortcuts, avoiding deep learning while still meeting course requirements.
- Preparing, organizing, and maintaining course material for AI-enhanced learning is time-consuming.
- Detecting AI-assisted cheating and ensuring assessments are "LLM-resilient" is challenging.
- Monitoring individual student progress at scale is difficult.

## 3. Objectives & Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Student Learning Enhancement** – Enable deeper, personalized learning of existing course material.
2. **Teacher Efficiency** – Reduce time spent on content preparation, grading, and progress monitoring.
3. **Responsible AI Use** – Promote socratic learning, prevent shortcut behavior, ensure academic integrity.

### Success Metrics:

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Student engagement with course chatbot | 70% weekly active users | Usage analytics |
| Student-reported learning improvement | 4+/5 satisfaction score | End-of-semester survey |
| Teacher time saved on grading | 30% reduction | Time-tracking survey |
| Cheating detection accuracy | 85%+ precision | Manual validation vs. system flags |
| LLM-resilient assignment completion | 90% of assignments pass resilience test | Internal assessment tool |

## 4. Target Audience & Personas

### Primary Personas:

#### **Persona 1: Computer Science Student**
- **Name:** Alex (Undergraduate, 2nd year)
- **Goals:** Understand course material deeply, prepare for exams, complete assignments efficiently.
- **Pain Points:** Material is dense, unclear where to start, wants personalized help without feeling "lost."
- **Needs:** Chatbot that guides learning, generates practice exercises, explains "why" topics matter.

#### **Persona 2: Course Instructor**
- **Name:** Dr. Sarah (CS Faculty, teaches Data Structures & Algorithms)
- **Goals:** Ensure students learn deeply, create fair assessments, monitor progress at scale.
- **Pain Points:** Time-consuming grading, difficulty detecting AI misuse, hard to personalize feedback.
- **Needs:** Tools to upload course material, track student progress, generate LLM-resilient assignments.

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints:
- Must integrate with existing course platforms (Moodle, Canvas, etc.).
- Privacy: Student data must remain confidential, GDPR/FERPA compliant.
- Teachers must manually review AI-generated grades and cheating flags.

### Assumptions:
- Teachers provide high-quality, consistent course material.
- Students have reliable internet access.
- Faculty approval for pilot deployment in 1-2 courses.

---

## 7. Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies:
- LLM API access (OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source models)
- RAG infrastructure (vector database, embedding models)
- Integration APIs for course platforms

### Risks:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Students rely on chatbot instead of learning | High | Socratic mode, progress tracking |
| Teachers distrust AI grading | Medium | Require manual review, transparency |
| Privacy breach of student data | High | Encryption, access controls, compliance audit |
| LLM generates incorrect answers | Medium | RAG grounding, confidence scores, feedback loop |
| Adoption resistance from faculty | Medium | Pilot with early adopters, training sessions |
