# Glossary – CourseLLM

<!-- Copilot: Maintain consistent terminology. Update as needed. -->

## Purpose
This glossary defines key terms used throughout the CourseLLM PRD and related documents. Consistent terminology ensures clarity for all stakeholders.

---

## Terms

### AI-Generated Content
Text, code, or other material produced by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) with minimal human intervention. In the context of cheating detection, refers to student submissions suspected of being entirely or substantially AI-produced.

---

### Assignment
A task given to students to assess their understanding of course material. Types include:
- **Quiz**: Multiple-choice or short-answer questions.
- **Coding Assignment**: Programming tasks with unit tests.
- **Essay**: Written analysis or explanation.
- **Exam**: High-stakes, time-bound assessment.

---

### Chatbot (Course Material Chatbot)
An AI-powered conversational agent that answers student questions about course content. Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate, grounded responses.

---

### Cheating Detection
Automated systems that flag suspicious student submissions, including:
- AI-generated text detection
- Plagiarism (copy-paste from other students or online sources)
- Anomalous submission patterns (e.g., sudden skill level jump)

---

### CourseLLM
The working title of the project. An AI-enhanced learning platform for CS courses at BGU.

---

### Course Material
Any educational content uploaded by instructors, including:
- Lecture slides (PDF, PPTX)
- Notes (DOCX, Markdown)
- Past exams and quizzes
- Exercises and solutions
- Reading lists

---

### Dependency Graph
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) showing prerequisite relationships between **Course Topics**. Used to enforce logical learning order (e.g., "Arrays" must be mastered before "Sorting Algorithms").

---

### Embedding
A numerical vector representation of text, used for semantic search in RAG. Generated by models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` or open-source alternatives.

---

### Grading Rubric
A structured set of criteria and point allocations for evaluating assignments. Used by instructors and AI grading assistants to ensure consistency.

---

### Instructor
A member of the CS faculty who teaches a course. Responsibilities include uploading course materials, defining learning trajectories, creating assignments, and monitoring student progress.

---

### Learning Trajectory
An ordered sequence of **Course Topics** that students must master. Includes:
- **Topic dependencies** (prerequisites)
- **Mastery criteria** (e.g., 80% quiz score)
- **Progress tracking** (per student)

---

### LLM (Large Language Model)
A type of AI model trained on vast text corpora, capable of generating human-like text. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Llama. Core technology behind CourseLLM's chatbot and grading assistance.

---

### LLM-Resilient Assignment
An assignment designed to resist trivial solving by LLMs like ChatGPT. Characteristics:
- Requires code explanation, not just code
- Includes constraints (e.g., "do not use library X")
- Tests conceptual understanding, not memorization
- May require multi-step reasoning or creativity

---

### Mastery Criteria
The conditions a student must meet to be considered "proficient" in a **Course Topic**. Examples:
- Score ≥80% on topic quiz
- Complete 5 practice exercises correctly
- Pass instructor-reviewed coding challenge

---

### Mastery Level
A numerical score (0-100%) representing a student's current proficiency in a **Course Topic**. Updated based on quiz scores, assignment grades, and chat interactions.

---

### Persona
A fictional but representative user of CourseLLM. Used to guide feature design. Key personas:
- **Alex** (Student): 2nd-year undergrad, wants personalized learning support.
- **Dr. Sarah** (Instructor): Faculty member, seeks efficiency and academic integrity tools.

---

### Progress Monitoring (Dashboard)
A visual interface for instructors showing:
- Aggregate class progress on learning trajectories
- Individual student progress
- Alerts for at-risk students

---

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique where an LLM retrieves relevant documents (course materials) before generating a response. Ensures answers are grounded in course content, reducing hallucinations.

---

### Socratic Learning
A teaching method where the instructor (or chatbot) asks clarifying questions to guide the student toward understanding, rather than providing direct answers. Goals:
- Expose misconceptions
- Encourage critical thinking
- Promote deeper learning

---

### Student
An undergraduate or graduate student enrolled in a CS course. Uses CourseLLM to:
- Ask questions via chatbot
- Track learning progress
- Generate practice quizzes
- Access supplementary resources

---

### Submission
A file or text uploaded by a student in response to an **Assignment**. May include code, essays, or quiz answers. Subject to grading and cheating detection.

---

### Topic (Course Topic)
A discrete concept or skill in a course's curriculum (e.g., "Linked Lists," "Recursion," "Big-O Notation"). Part of a **Learning Trajectory**.

---

### Vector Database
A database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors (**Embeddings**). Used in RAG for fast semantic search over course materials. Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma.
