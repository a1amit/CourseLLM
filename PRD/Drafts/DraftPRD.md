# CourseLLM – Product Requirements Document (Draft)

<!-- Copilot: This is the initial draft. Review and refine sections before promoting to PRD.md -->

## 1. Overview & Vision

**Product Name:** CourseLLM (working title)

**Vision:**  
Help teachers and students in a Computer Science Department at university better teach and learn using AI that enhances existing course material.

<!-- Copilot: please expend some on what is context-aware, context aware with respect to what? -->
**Core Principle:**  
CourseLLM does not create new material or replace existing AI tools (NotebookLM, chatbots). Instead, it enhances the learning experience around existing course material by providing intelligent, context-aware assistance.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### For Students:
- Students want enhanced, personalized access to course material to learn better, deeper, and faster.
- Current tools lack integration with specific course context and learning trajectories.
- Students need help understanding "why" material matters, not just "how" it works.

### For Teachers:
- Teachers worry students use AI as shortcuts, avoiding deep learning while still meeting course requirements.
- Preparing, organizing, and maintaining course material for AI-enhanced learning is time-consuming.
- Detecting AI-assisted cheating and ensuring assessments are "LLM-resilient" is challenging.
- Monitoring individual student progress at scale is difficult.
